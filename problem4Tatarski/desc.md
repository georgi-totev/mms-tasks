1. Write a higher-order function called map. Map takes an array and a callback function that must be called on each element of the array. Map changes each element of the array to the result of calling the function on it.

2. Write a function called filter. The function takes source and destination arrays and a predicate function. Filter copies all elements from the source array to the destination array for which the predicate function returns true.

3. Write map and filter functions that work for arbitrary types (not just a fixed type) without using templates.

4. Write a function that can sort arrays of arbitrary types. The order in which the elements are sorted must be passed as a callback function.

5. Write a function that finds the cube root of its argument. It is forbidden to use mathematical functions from the standard library.

6. Write a function that finds the length of a character string.

7. Write a function that returns a pointer to the first occurrence of a given character in a given character string.

8. Write a function that returns a pointer to the first character of the first occurrence of the given character string needle in the character string haystack.

9. Write a function that compares two character strings lexicographically. The result of the function should be the same as the result of strcmp (man strcmp).

10. Create the following functions for working with arrays:
-- add an element at a specified position in the array. All subsequent elements are shifted to the right.
-- remove an element at a specified position in the array. All subsequent elements are shifted to the left.
-- reverse the order of the elements in the array
